We prove that if the velocity field of such a\nsolution has no zeroes and real analytic Bernoulli function, then it can be\nrescaled to the Reeb vector field of a stable Hamiltonian structure. In\nparticular, such a vector field has a periodic orbit unless the 3-manifold is a\ntorus bundle over the circle. We provide a counterexample showing that the\ncorrespondence breaks down without the real analyticity hypothesis.\n"
